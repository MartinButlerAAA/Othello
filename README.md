# Othello

This is a Wii U Homebrew version of the Othello game. 

The player plays against the computer, alternating who plays first. The aim is to surround and flip the opponents pieces to your colour; the one with the most at the end is the winner.

These are the full [Rules and Instructions for Reversi and Othello](https://www.mastersofgames.com/rules/reversi-othello-rules.htm).

Hope you like it.

The game makes use of osscreen and sndcore2 code I developed for previous games, see [PacMan-ish Wiki](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/PacMan-ishU/wiki) and [Connect4U](https://github.com/MartinButlerAAA/Connect4U).
